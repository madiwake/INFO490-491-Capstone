        "question": "How do I apply for accommodations?",
        "answer": "To apply for accommodations simply visit https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/ From there, select and complete the application! When filling out the form, be sure to be as detailed as possible and list any potential struggles or barriers you may face, even if things feel insignificant to you at the time. Additionally, remember to seek out documentation of a disability or hindrance to your education, as submitting documentation (i.e. a letter from your therapist, your doctor, psychiatrist, etc.) is required when applying for accommodations!"

        "question": "How do I reach out to my professor or TA to talk about my accommodations?",
        "answer": "Reaching out to professors at the beginning of each quarter to discuss your specific accommodations is something that DRS strongly recommends. This practice ensures that you resolve any potential course alterations or address any incompatibility issues regarding the course structure and your accommodations before they even arise. When reaching out, it can be most convenient to email your professor (and TA if necessary) to introduce yourself, and briefly explain the potential need to schedule a meeting to discuss specific applications of various accommodations. When doing this, you do not have to share why you have accommodations and professors and are not legally allowed to ask! Use the following example as inspiration when reaching out to your professors. Ex. Hello, My name is ______ and I am in your ______ class this quarter. I wanted to reach out because I have established accommodations through DRS at UW. You should have received an email from DRS detailing all my accommodations. I was hoping to discuss how my specific accommodations will be met while I engage in course content. Communication via email is fine with me, but if you would prefer meeting briefly via zoom or in-person to discuss my accommodations, please let me know. Thanks, ______. If a meeting is deemed necessary, simply walk through your accommodations with your professor and discuss how they will be applied!"

Follow the prompt and submit a form to request additional accommodations. Alternatively, you can reach out directly to your primary DRS advisor and request a meeting to discuss your current struggle and to inquire about potential accommodations to help you. Your primary advisor’s information can be found on the left-hand side of the website under the navigation bar."

        "question": "I need to be better organized, where do I start?",
        "answer": "To-do lists are one of the most beneficial, yet simple things you can do to stay organized. To-do lists allow for easily adding and removing items as they come up (i.e. a professor mentions a due date for an assignment coming up, so you quickly add the assignment on your to-do list along with its due date). Additionally, note-taking applications can make it easier to organize your notes and allow for more efficient studying. Some recommended note-taking applications: Goodnotes, Notability, Notion, OneNote."
