### Problem Statement:
How might students with disabilities find a community and resources comfortably
so that they can succeed within higher education and beyond school?

### Problem Background:
#### Context:
The current DRS website doesn't have a way for students with DRS accommodations to build their community and to discover beneficial resources. Beyond getting established accommodations, DRS does not have the means to support students further, as the quantity of students who have disabilities exceeds the resources accessible through DRS directly. Students often question how to approach speaking about their accommodations with professors, what certain accommodations do or don’t do, where they might seek out additional resources, and where to find other people who are seeking connections and a community. Students who need, but do not receive this additional assistance can struggle within not only their professional and educational lives, but their personal lives as well.
#### Information Problem:
The problem regarding not having a current community building resource can be solved through a web application that is potentially an extension of the DRS website, and offers a means of finding communities of like minded people. The issue of readily available resources can be solved by providing more resources to students in our solution, and making this section easily accessible. To assist students with disabilities with navigating high education - beyond having accommodations - we can provide resources like “frequently asked questions,” or “how-to” aids to people students navigating the impacts of having accommodations.
